# Visualisation-and-Classification-of-Novel-COVID-19-Dataset
Visualisation and Classification of Novel COVID-19 Dataset

The first goal of this project is visualizations with graph
from daily COVID-19 data of several countries by change
graph and cumulative graph of death, recovered, confirmed
and active patients in a user interface. Also, whether is graph
proportional to population or counts of each data could be
selected in this interface.
The other goal is classifying countries with: stage of epidemic;
counts of death cases and confirmed cases per population;
days until first peak time from begin of pandemic.
In this case, different daily data of COVID-19 are easily
interpreted and deduce for a country from countries has same
characteristics.
Thus, continuum and similarities of pandemic could easily
observable.
